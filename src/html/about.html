                <h1>Hi, my name is Nico Butterfield.</h1>

                <p>
                    I am a Computer Science major and Creative Writing minor at Colgate University. 
                    I am quite passionate about both subjects and hope to use my skills in them to bring a unqiue perspective to the world of programming. 
                    The goal behind the creation this website is to not only share the work I've done in these two fields, but to also give prosepctive employers a chance to get to know me a bit better beyond a one page resume.
                    I've been advised by mutliple people not to put excesive amounts of my personal information on the internet, so I can't tell you too much, but I can tell you that
                    I'm an understanding, easy-going and empathetic person who loves working with others and is thrilled to get his career started. Additionally, all the photographs used in the other pages of this website 
                    were taken by me. If you'd like to see the rest feel free to click  <a href = "../html/photos.html" style = "color: lightseagreen;">this link</a>.
